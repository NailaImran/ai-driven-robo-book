## 🚀 Tips for Success

### Week 1 (Planning)
1. **Start early** - Don't wait until the last week
2. **Use existing packages** - Don't reinvent the wheel
3. **Test incrementally** - Get each module working before integration
4. **Ask for help** - Use office hours and discussion forums

### Week 2 (Implementation)
1. **Commit often** - Version control is your friend
2. **Document as you go** - Don't leave it for the end
3. **Record test videos** - Useful for debugging and final demo
4. **Handle edge cases** - What happens when detection fails?

### Week 3 (Documentation)
1. **Polish the demo** - Edit out long pauses
2. **Write clearly** - Assume reader is smart but unfamiliar
3. **Include visuals** - A picture is worth 1000 words
4. **Proofread everything** - Typos hurt professionalism

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Hardcoding paths (`/home/yourname/...`)
- ❌ Not testing on clean system
- ❌ Waiting until last minute
- ❌ Ignoring error messages
- ❌ Skipping code documentation
- ❌ Poor video quality
- ❌ Missing citations in report
