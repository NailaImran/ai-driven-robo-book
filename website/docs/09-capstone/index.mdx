## FAQ

**Q: Can I use pre-trained models?**
A: Yes! Use YOLO, GPT-4, etc. But you must integrate them yourself.

**Q: Can I work in a team?**
A: Teams of 2 are allowed. Both members must contribute equally.

**Q: What if my simulation crashes during the demo?**
A: Record multiple takes and edit. Include blooper reel at the end for fun!

**Q: Can I use a different robot than humanoid?**
A: Discuss with instructor. Must still demonstrate bipedal locomotion.

**Q: Do I need real hardware?**
A: No, simulation is sufficient. Hardware deployment is bonus points.
