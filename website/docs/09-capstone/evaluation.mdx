## Grade Appeals

If you believe your grade is incorrect:

1. **Review rubric carefully** - most disputes come from misunderstanding criteria
2. **Check for partial credit** - you may have received points you didn't notice
3. **Prepare evidence** - video timestamps, code references, metrics
4. **Submit written appeal** within 1 week of grade release
5. **Meet with instructor** to discuss

**Note**: Grade appeals may result in lower scores if errors in your favor are discovered.

---

## Tips for Maximizing Your Score

1. **Start with core requirements** - don't attempt bonus features until all base functionality works
2. **Test thoroughly** - record metrics from 10+ trials, not just one successful run
3. **Document as you go** - don't wait until the end
4. **Follow the rubric** - check each criterion specifically
5. **Proofread everything** - spelling/grammar errors hurt professionalism
6. **Record backup videos** - if one demo fails, you have alternatives
7. **Ask for feedback early** - office hours are your friend
