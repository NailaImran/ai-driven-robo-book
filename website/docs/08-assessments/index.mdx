# Assessments

This chapter contains all module assessments and evaluation rubrics. Each assessment tests the skills learned in its corresponding module.

---

## Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

### **Project**: Mobile Robot Navigation System

**Objective**: Build a complete ROS 2 application for a simulated mobile robot

**Requirements**:
1. Teleoperation node (keyboard → `/cmd_vel`)
2. Sensor fusion node (camera + odometry)
3. Obstacle avoidance node (laser scan → reactive control)
4. State publisher (robot pose → `/tf`)
5. Launch file (start all nodes)
6. ROS bag (record 1 minute of data)

**Rubric** (100 points):
- Functionality (40 pts): Robot navigates 10m without collisions
- Code quality (20 pts): Proper naming, structure, comments
- ROS 2 best practices (20 pts): QoS, logging, parameters
- Launch file (10 pts): Single-command startup
- Documentation (10 pts): README with setup instructions

**Deliverables**:
- Source code (GitHub repo)
- Demo video (2-3 min)
- README

**Due**: End of Week 5
