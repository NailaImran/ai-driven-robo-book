### **Path 1: Beginner (All Weeks)**
Complete all 13 weeks sequentially. Ideal for students with no robotics experience.

### **Path 2: Accelerated (10 Weeks)**
Skip Weeks 1-2 (Physical AI Intro) if you already understand robotics fundamentals.
Focus on ROS 2, simulation, and Isaac platform.

### **Path 3: Specialization Tracks**

**Software Engineering Focus**:
- Weeks 3-5 (ROS 2) + Week 6-7 (Simulation) + Capstone

**AI/ML Focus**:
